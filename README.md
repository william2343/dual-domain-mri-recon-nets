# Dual-domain Accelerated MRI Reconstruction using Transformers with Learning-based Undersampling
Python implementation in PyTorch of the models outlined in the above titled paper. We use a dual domain (image and k-space) approach using transformers, coupled with learning-based undersampling to perform accelerated reconstruction of dynamic MRI images. Paper to come.
